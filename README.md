# Gesture-Recognition
This system implements a touchless Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) mechanism for controlling a media player using hand gestures. The solution leverages MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition, deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 (RPI5) as an edge computing device.
